I'm a recent graduate of the University of British Columbia's [Master of Data Science](https://ubc-mds.github.io/) program, former captain of [SFU Men's Soccer](http://athletics.sfu.ca/index.aspx?path=msoc) and outdoor enthusiast. On this website, I am sharing projects on things that I am passionate about. This may include: technology, politics, sports, psychology and whatever else is currently on my mind.
