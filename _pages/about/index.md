I'm a graduate of the University of British Columbia's [Master of Data Science](https://ubc-mds.github.io/) program and former captain of [SFU Men's Soccer](http://athletics.sfu.ca/index.aspx?path=msoc). Currently, I work as a Data Scientist at the Siemens Motion Control Plant in Erlangen Germany and play semi-professional soccer at ATSV Erlangen. 

On this website, I am sharing data science projects on things that I am passionate about. This may include: technology, literature, politics, sports, and whatever else is currently on my mind.
